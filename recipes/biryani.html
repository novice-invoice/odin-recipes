		<li>3-4 green chilies, slit lengthwise</li>
		<li>1/4 cup cooking oil or ghee</li>
		<li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
		<li>2 bay leaves</li>
		<li>6-8 green cardamom pods</li>
		<li>6-8 whole cloves</li>
		<li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
		<li>2 tsp coriander powder</li>
		<li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
		<li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
		<li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
		<li>1 tsp salt</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
		<li>A pinch of saffron (optional)</li>
		<li>2 tbsp warm milk (optional)</li>
		<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves (coriander leaves)</li>
		<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
		<li>1/4 cup fried onions (optional)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Wash the rice thoroughly and soak it in cold water for 30 minutes.</li>
		<li>In a large mixing bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, garlic, ginger, green chilies, 1 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Cover and marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the refrigerator for more flavor)</li>
		<li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil or ghee over medium-high heat. Add the whole spices (cinnamon stick, bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, and cumin seeds) and sauté for 30 seconds or until fragrant.</li>
		<li>Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown (about 10-12 minutes). Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for another 5-7 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and pulpy.</li>
		<li>Add the marinated chicken (along with the marinade) and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
		<li>Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pot along with 4 cups of water. Add coriander powder, cumin powder, turmeric, chili powder, and 1 tsp salt. Stir well.</li>
		<li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the liquid has been absorbed.</li>
		<li>In a small bowl, soak a pinch of saffron (if using) in warm milk for 5-10 minutes.</li>
		<li>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from heat and let it sit covered for 10-15 minutes. Then, fluff the rice with a fork and sprinkle the saffron-infused milk (if using) over the top.</li>
		<li>Garnish with chopped cilantro leaves, mint leaves, and fried onions (if using). Serve hot with raita or chutney on the side.</li>
