	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p2>Ceviche is a Latin American dish that typically consists of raw fish or seafood that is marinated in citrus juices (usually lime or lemon) and seasoned with spices like chili peppers, onions, and cilantro. The acid from the citrus juice "cooks" the fish, resulting in a texture that is firm yet tender. Ceviche is often served cold and may be accompanied by avocado, corn, and/or plantain chips. It is a refreshing and flavorful dish that is popular throughout Latin America, particularly in coastal regions. There are many variations of ceviche, with different types of seafood and seasonings used depending on the region and personal preference.</p2>
