	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Poutine is a popular Canadian dish that originated in Quebec. It consists of crispy French fries that are topped with fresh cheese curds and rich gravy. The dish is typically made by first frying the French fries until they are golden and crispy, then adding a generous amount of cheese curds on top. Finally, a hot gravy made from beef or chicken stock is poured over the fries and cheese curds, creating a delicious and savory flavor combination. Poutine can be served as a hearty snack or as a main dish, and is often enjoyed with a cold beer or other beverage. It has become a beloved staple of Canadian cuisine and can now be found in many restaurants and food trucks throughout the country.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>4-5 large potatoes, peeled and cut into thin fries</li>

		<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>1 cup cheese curds</li>
		<li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>

		<li>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.</li>
		<li>Rinse the cut fries in cold water to remove excess starch. Dry them with a clean kitchen towel.</li>
		<li>Spread the fries on a baking sheet in a single layer. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 20-30 minutes until golden and crispy.</li>
